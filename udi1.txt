When I get older losing my hair
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
You'll be older too
I could stay with you
When your lights have gone
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Who could ask for more
When I'm sixty-four
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
Grandchildren on your knee
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
