Many years from now
Birthday greetings bottle of wine
Would you lock the door
When I'm sixty-four
And if you say the word
I could be handy, mending a fuse
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
Every summer we can rent a cottage
We shall scrimp and save
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Stating point of view
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Mine for evermore
When I'm sixty-four
